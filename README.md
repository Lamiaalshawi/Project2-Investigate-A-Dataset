# Project2: Investigate A Dataset
In this project, I analyzed a dataset and then communicate my findings about it. I used the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib to make my analysis easier. I chose TMDb movie data, this dataset contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb), including cast, release year, budget and revenue.
